# Rotated Array
1. **Search element in rotated array - I** <br />
   Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. The array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.
2. **Search element in rotated array - II** <br />
   Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicate values) and a target value k. The array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Return True if k is present and otherwise, return False.
