3. Find | First | Last | Total number of | occurance(s) of a given number in a sorted array.

# Rotated Array
1. **Search element in rotated array - I** <br />
   Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. The array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.
2. **Search element in rotated array - II** <br />
   Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicate values) and a target value k. The array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Return True if k is present and otherwise, return False.
3. **Minimum in rotated sorted array**  
   Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). The array is rotated between 1 to N times which is unknown. Find the minimum element in the array.
4. **Number of times array is rotated**  
   Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). The array is rotated between 1 to N times which is unknown. Find how many times the array has been rotated.

# Search element
1. **Search single element in sorted array**  
   Given an array of N integers. Every number in the array except one appears twice. Find the single number in the array.
2. **Peak element in array**
   Given an array of length N. Peak element is defined as the element greater than both of its neighbors. Formally, if ‘arr[i]’ is the peak element then ‘arr[i – 1]’ < ‘arr[i]’ and ‘arr[i + 1]’ < ‘arr[i]’. Find the index(0-based) of a peak element in the array. If there are multiple peak numbers, return the index of any peak number.  
   Note: For the first element, the previous element should be considered as negative infinity. For the last element, the next element should be considered as negative infinity.
