1. **Frog Jump**  
   There is a frog on the `1st` step of an `N` stairs long staircase. The frog want to reach the last `Nth` stair. `Height[i]` is the height of the ith stair. If the frog jumps from `ith` stair to the `jth` stair, the energy lost in the jump is given by the absolute value of (`Height[i] - Height[j]`). If the frog is on the ith stair, he can jump either on the `(i+1)th` stair or `(i+2)th` stair. Your task is to find the minimum total energy used by the frog to reach from `1st` stair to `Nth` stair.
