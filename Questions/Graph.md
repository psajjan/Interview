# Graph

## DFS/BFS

1. **Number of Provinces**  
   Given an undirected graph with `V` vertices. We say two vertices `u` and `v` belong to a single province if there is a path from `u` to `v` or `v` to `u`. Your task is to find the number of provinces.

3. **Rotten Oranges : Min time to rot all oranges**  
   You are given an `m x n` grid, where each cell has the following values :<br>
   2  -  represents a rotten orange<br>
   1  -  represents a Fresh orange<br>
   0  -  represents an Empty Cell<br>
   Every minute, if a Fresh Orange is adjacent to a Rotten Orange in any of the 4-directions ( upward, downwards, right, and left ), it becomes Rotten.  
   Return the minimum number of minutes required to turn all Fresh Oranges to Rotten Oranges. If it's not possible, return -1.
